However, for purpose of developing actionable insights it is a very limiting measure and we will explain here why.

    "2. $R_0$ is proportional to the effective transmissivity $\\beta$, a contact parameter proportional to the number of susceptible population $N_s$ and/or density of $N_s$. The measured $R_0$ is derived with an assumed $N_s$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if $R_0 >1$, even a few infections will force the system to an outbreak with exponential growth at the onset that's given by $I(t) = I(t_0)$ $\\exp$$^{(\\beta -\\gamma)}$$^{(t - t_0)}$  where $R_0 = \\beta /\\gamma$ for the SIR model. See previous notebook for discussion. This leads us to the third point:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is indeed critical to make sure that $R_0 < 1.0$ since this will guarantee that the highest number of infection will no longer exceed the numbers reported daily. However, consider always go back to lesson of item 2 since $R_0$ is a function of the current environment when it was measured and it can exceed 1.0 immediately after opening. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. If one wants to modify the quarantine when $R_0 > 1.0$, here is the most important policy measure that must be defined:   **Setting of an acceptable $P_{\\texttt{outbreak}}$.**  The threshold number of cases ($I_{\\texttt{threshold}}$ or the maximum cases reported that day) that will allow the extinction to go below the set $P_{\\texttt{outbreak}}$ is given by:\n",

A prudent compromise on safety and accuracy is to assume $R_t \\sim 1.2 - 1.4$ will be the immediate $R_t$ after opening, this is an acceptable estimate pre-quarantine for COVID19 with the assumption we better value social distancing after quarantine. \n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A. **Transportation limit.** Maintaining social distance in previously cramped MRT means reducing the capacity by $1/3.75$ for a 1 meter social distancing protocal (from initially ~ 3 by 5 = 15 you reduce the space to 4/15 =1/3.75) and 1/12.5 for a 2 meter social distancing protocal (5 by 10 = 50 you shrink the space by 4/50 =1/12.5). This does not take into account the queue of the MRT in usual days. A good compromise is probably to initially set the transport limit to 1/15 to 1/20 of the commuters. This means that we should have a continuing workforce calculated under modified ECQ in the range of 5 to 6.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. **Office space limit.**  We expect that transport sets the lower limit (MRT is more cramped than office), so this can be relaxed. However, regular testing should be be done to the \"super-spreaders\" who can be teachers in classrooms, cashiers in groceries, or errand staff from offices. Our recommendation, every 3-4 days to capture the early infectious state.\n",

    "1. If quarantine is lifted, start the modification by limiting the workforce in NCR by 5 to 7% of workers per office. This can be more relaxed in other cities or provinces having a more efficient transport system per capita. Priotizing employees residing near the office will have the benefit of relaxing further transport congestion and spreading of virus due to prolonged contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. if quarantine is lifted, test potential super-spreaders every 3-4 days, (maybe) this cost can be shouldered by the institution who would like to fully return to operation.\n"
